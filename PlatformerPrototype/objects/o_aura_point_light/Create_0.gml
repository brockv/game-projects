/// Initialise light

// NOTES: This is an example point light. Lights are INSTANCE based, therefore 
// it is one light per-instance, and multiple lights cannot be assigned to a single 
// instance. This may not be the most performance efficient way to do things, but this 
// engine was designed for a compromise of performance with ease of use.
//
// The light will use the assigned sprite_index for drawing and for the best effect 
// the sprite should be white or grey-scale. You can colour the light and set it's
// alpha value using the variables assigned in the script below.
//
// The light instances should NOT be visible, and in this demo project the 
// visible flag is set to false in the object properties.
// 
// All light instances MUST BE CHILDREN OF o_aura_light_parent, otherwise they 
// will not be drawn.


// Set up light

// First assign the sprite. You can assign the sprite in the object editor if 
// you wish, but I do it here to make editing the room easier.

sprite_index = s_aura_point_light;

// Now initialise the light (see the script for the arguments)
//Aura_Light_Init(128, make_color_rgb(random(256), random(256), random(256)), 0.8 + random(0.2), true);
Aura_Light_Init(128, c_white, 0.8, true);
